                <h3>I follow many core values in my life. From growing up low-income background, I've had many experiences that have shaped who I am as
                    a person and who I hopefully want to be in the future. However, that is still to change as I am constantly evolving my thoughts.
                    Below is a list of the six most important things I believe in life to be:

                </h3>
                <!--Create ordered lists that talk about the 6 most important things I believe in-->
                <ol>
                    <li>Health</li>
                    <p>Health is vital for success. One of the most important lessons that my relatives told me when I was in Shanghai this Summer
                        was to take care of my health for without a healthy body, one will never achieve the dreams they can. Imagine getting a 4.0
                        in all your classes, landing a full time offer at your dream company, but being overworked to the point that you have a life
                        expectancy of less than 30. That wouldn't be fun for you or your family/friends. I always make sure to keep my health up. Despite
                        the fact that I mostly sleep at 3 AM now, I regularly get in my exercise and stay physically active.
                    </p>
                    <li>Relationships</li>
                    <p>To be successful beyond studies and affluence is having healthy connections with family and friends. Think about it: if you
                        had all the money in the world but no people you love, no person who cares for you, you would feel empty even with millions
                        in the bank. Making genuine friendships and creating these real connections with the people around you is important in mainting
                        a healthy and successful life, where you have a support network and get to experience memorable events with them.
                        <br>
                        Something I ound hard in University was keeping up with old high school friends given the amount of work. However, I realize
                        that even though your paths have crossed, it isn't the end of the road. I still make effort to talk to them once every few weeks
                        checking up on them.

                        For family, it is even more important. Especially for an international (Yes, Canadians too!) like myself, it is still important
                        to stay involved in their lives and keep them updated. Just a few days ago, I actually had a wonderful conversation with my grandpa
                        who was asking how I was along with many of my other relatives. I also make sure to chat with my mom at least once a week to keep
                        her updated on my life, despite how busy it gets.

                        Part of University is finding out how to balance your life and have a set priority, and for me these relationships with families, old
                        friends, and new friends will always have its place there.
                    </p>
                    <li>Money</li>

                    <p>Money is also part of things I value because it is an asset that you need to become financially free. Coming from a low-income background
                        and being raised only by my mom, I've realized the hardships she's gone through and the financials that go by our day-to-day lives. While
                        money alone won't guarantee you success and happiness, it is important to unlock the potential things you can do and relieve many of the
                        financial stress that many people work so hard everyday to accomplish. That's why I hope to work hard to one: do what I want to do in the future
                        to change the world and two: make money in the process.

                    </p>
                    <li>Introspection</li>

                    <p> In life, one of the most important things that separate humans from other animals is our ability to think and improve.
                        I've always seen my life as a dynamic and evolving one, where through time, experiences, and growth, I view things in a different
                        light and construct evolving perspectives in my thoughts and the way I do things. I've kept a journal since grade 8, and I feel like
                        spending those solitary times before I sleep reflecting on my day, my thoughts, things I'm grateful for allows me to understand my
                        strengths, weaknesses, and desires better. It is also a great way to look back in the future and see how much I've grown. It allows me
                        to have clarity about my life and have a fresh sense of my goals in life as well as an in-depth understanding of the very person I am.
                        <br>

                        Though I've been busy at Harvard, I make time to journal and think about things going on in my life as well as the life of my family.
                        It has been really busy, but I still reflect at night and write things down in my journal. I sometimes also explore Boston and just
                        spend the day seeing the city and just taking my personal time.
                    </p>

                    <li>Grit</li>
                    <p>At Harvard, I know everyone here is smart. Everyone here was chosen by the admissions committee for a reason but I've always thought
                        what characteristics super successful people like Jeff Bezos have. The answer, I believe, is having grit. It is not just the fact that
                        you are smart and can ace all your tests at school. It's not the fact that you can solve pHD level problems in half an hour. It's the
                        fact that you have grit, the fact that you can work tirelessly towards a goal through all the deep thoughts in your mind that prevent you
                        from doing such a thing and work through all the excuses you make to try and convince yourself to not do something. It's simply the fact
                        that you just keep going at something relentlessly; even at the deepest of times, you still hold out hope and
                        <br>
                        <b>you keep persevering.</b>
                        <br>

                        I was on the waitlist for Harvard and after Ivy day I was absolutely devastated. I was rejected from every school I applied to except for
                        UCSD and I was on my way there. I was also well aware of the statistic that Harvard took low double digits from a waitlist of thousands of
                        students. However, after a week I had an epiphany. While it was statistically harder for me to get in, I realized that I still had to shoot
                        my shot; my journey didn't end there. Through the entire waitlist process, I thought to myself that even if Harvard took one student of the waitlist
                        this year, that person would be me.
                        <br>
                        I drafted the best LOCI, rec letters, got my guidance to call the admissions department and other waitlist supplements. When Harvard released the yield of a little over 84% and sent out the first
                        round of rejections to people on the waitlist saying their class was entirely full, I was a bit shook. This could have been one of the years
                        where they took no one off the waitlist. However, I never gave up and never stopped believing. Fast forward to May 31st, I received my acceptance - I was overjoyed.

                        I always do things with all my strength and never give up until the matter has had a proper outcome, and I won't stop doing things like that. In fact,
                        I hope to develop more grit through tougher challenges in life that I know will follow me for the rest of my life.
                    </p>

                    <li>Community Service</li>
                    <p> Number 6 is Community Service. I have always believed in giving back to my community and using my skillset to help the people around me.
                        I believe that the world would be a better place if everyone were to be kind and help others in need and I follow the philosophy that wherever
                        I go, I will always make an impact through my actions. In high school, I did a lot of community service. I served as a buddy and assistant teacher
                        for my school's ASD class, volunteered at an organization that helped underprivileged kids with public speaking, and played violin for senior homes.
                        Community service is a part of me that I will always believe in.

                        <br>

                        Even through all this community service that have helped people, I never realized how much impact my actions would have.
                        Near the end of my activities, many people whom I volunteered for surprised me with gifts and their thankfulness of how much
                        I have done for them. For example, for playing at senior homes some of them tried giving me a tip and talked about how grateful
                        they were to have a volunteer play music once a week for them.

                        <br>
                        Giving back to the community that has created such a positive influence and environemnt
                        on me is something I will do. At Harvard, I am also volunteering for the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and I hope to do more wherever my path leads me
                        in life.
